enough to distribute to nearby team mates even when under immense pressure from opposition forwards sometimes it goes woefully wrong but the coach has kept his faith in simon no matter the criticism

cruising against japan at the start of the second half simon played the ball out to alejandro balde who was immediately pressed and lost possession ritsu doan drove the loose ball past simon at his near post from the edge of the box simon got a hand on it and might have kept it out with some claiming manchester united goalkeeper david de gea would have saved the shot itv pundit gary neville claimed simon seemed a real weak point for la roja later advocating for de gea however he was never likely to be selected with luis enrique bringing david raya from brentford and robert sanchez of brighton as simon s back ups two goalkeepers more comfortable with the ball at their feet and who create fewer headlines they will have low expectations of featuring with luis enrique making it clear that the year old is his no if unai didn t play well with his feet he couldn t be the goalkeeper of the national team said luis enrique after spain s draw with germany unai simon has everything spain s goalkeeper needs comfortableluis enrique says when simon errs it does not worry him as long as he is carrying out the plan set for him the coach s explanations won over the athletic bilbao stopper who emerged after kepa arrizabalaga left for chelsea for a world record million pound million euro fee for a goalkeeper he established himself in with athletic making his spain debut a year later and being selected at euro against croatia simon let pedri s back pass slip past his foot for a spectacular own goal but redeemed himself with penalty saves against switzerland in the quarter finals unfortunately for spain he could not repeat the trick against italy in the semis and the azzurri progressed keeping hold of the no jersey through that tournament ensured simon bought further into luis enrique s way of playing for me it s not a risk said simon ahead of the japan clash this national team has known how to solve these situations multiple times and that s how it will be that s the idea that the coach wants and he s convinced me of it and i am comfortable with it luis enrique hinted his team might work on being a little more pragmatic with longer passes accepting the japan loss as a warning if against morocco we have the fortune to go in front morocco will risk it all at full pelt again said the coach this has to serve as a warning that this is going to happen then again given the coach s belief in his system he may even ask simon to double down on the existing strategy it could generate a tense situation and the pressure will keep increasing in the knock out games added
